# StreamSSL

This is a framework which allows you to implement a TLS client or multi-threaded server in C++ relatively easily. It includes a working example and allows for server and optional client authentication.

The whole project is fully described [here](Article/Article.md), it was originally a CodeProject article [here](
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1000189/A-Working-TCP-Client-and-Server-With-SSL).

It is licensed under the CodeProject Open License (see the [License.md](License.md) file in the project) also available [here](https://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx).
